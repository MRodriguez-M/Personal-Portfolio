                    <h2>Toy Problems</h2>
                    <p>
                        A collection of JavaScript-only toy problems I have solved since I first started learning to code in JS.
                        Working on these has allowed me to practice and improve my skills with data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.
                        I also introduced myself to Jest by writing unit tests for several of the toy problems.
                        An ever-growing list, I love to take on new toy problems every now and then to keep my abilities fresh and have fun while doing it.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Authentication System</h2>
                    <p>
                        An authentication system that accepts user credntials and validates them, giving the user access to their information with a successful login.
                        This program is a JavaScript/Node.js translation and enhancement of one I had originally written in Java.
                        While the original only included the login aunthentication and display of info, this version incorporates complete CRUD functionality.
                        The project uses arrays and functions to authenticate a user and allows them to complete several actions using a menu.
                        Security practices are implemented through an MD5 hash for the password.
                        As this was meant to be practice for back-end development, a UI wasn't added until I made a React app version of the project which can be seen in the React projects section.
