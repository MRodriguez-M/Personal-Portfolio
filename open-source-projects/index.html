                    <h2>Random Quote Generator</h2>
                    <p>
                        An app that displays a random quote and changes the displayed quote at the click of a button.
                        The State Hook is used to help generate a random index number that determines which quote from an array will be displayed on screen.
                        A handle click function not only displays a quote at the click of a designated button, but it also ensures that each quote is cycled through before repeating them.
                        This was a fun one for me as it allowed me to pratice the basics of programming with React while expressing my creative side through designing a minimalist page and selecting some of my favorite quotes.

                    <p>
                        A page that takes user-input Markdown and converts it to formatted text.
                        The State Hook and an onChange function are used to keep track of the text the user is creating in the <code>textarea</code> window, with the Marked library parsing the input and converting it to Markdown in a preview window.
                        All styling is executed with CSS and Flexbox.
                        I took this project as an opportunity to reinforce some of the skills I had developed but not yet practiced much, including Flexbox, JS libraries, and React Hooks.

                    <h2>Authentication System</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is the MERN stack version of the authentication system I wrote in vanilla JavaScript.
                        A program I consider my baby, this was the capstone project for my undergraduate studies.
                        Meant to be a culmination of everything I learned througout my college education, I decided to challenge myself by creating an entire full-stack app using technologies I hadn't really worked with before.
                        I built the front-end with React that brought the UI to life with a mix of JS, HTML, and CSS.
                        The back-end operated with and connected to the front with a combination of Node, Express, and a MongoDB database.
                        Considering this was effectively my first real attempt at a full-stack app, I am proud that I was able to acheive a fully functional MVP in about a month.
                        I've made improvements to the project since I first completed it and plan to continue making additions in the form of more functionality.
